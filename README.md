# ‚≠ê Starstone - my main project
Starstone is my own operating system. It works in real mode (16-bit). It can read files from FAT12/FAT16/EXT2 formatted partitions/drives. It has a simple but buggy shell (which is for testing only anyway, I will make a proper one). It will be able to run DOS programs in the future. I'll be happy to get some feedback on this project

# üì∫ My YouTube channel
If you're interested in Starstone you can watch my devlogs. I plan to upload them every week.
